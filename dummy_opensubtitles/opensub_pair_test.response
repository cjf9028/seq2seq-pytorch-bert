colwyn is a great fighter .
you will face the beast , who is their leader .
without the glaive , you will never be able to reach lyssa .
where is this place ?
noble sentiments , but we fight for profit .
the profit' s freedom .
if the slayers conquer krull , your sons will be enslaved forever .
that' s what friends are supposed to do for each other .
we' re in sight of the trees , brother .
if you ain' t got money , you go in the garbage .
