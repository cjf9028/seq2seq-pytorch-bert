if it were anyone but turold' s son .
in the fortress , you will face more than the slayers .
in a cave on the highest peak .
i might have been sucked to my death while you stood there gawking !
if the invaders conquer , you' il be slaves with the rest of us .
you know what i mean ?
how did you know i had sons ?
i saw you save the boy from a spear .
i recognise the place now .
mamma' s boy is holding out .
